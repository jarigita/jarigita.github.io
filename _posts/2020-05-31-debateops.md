## DebateOps

It's a technical blog about software development, about real problems that I have encountered, how to improve productivity or to avoid always making the same mistakes, focused on Agile, devops. We always want to put simple examples, with code, with docker that you can try. We do not believe that the solution is a tool or a platform(although of course we will talk about tools), we believe in people,  the change (continuous everything) is made by people, that's why we are not going to provide magic solutions, only suggest a debate, show ideas, ways to apply them, starting from the why and what for.  
<br>
The main things that we will see in this blog.
<br>
The first thing is that we want to apply Agile and Devops in a project.
The project to put it simple is this blog, we want to create a public project with tools in java and python, tools that help us when developing and generating more and better code.
<br>
This project will be stored in github, as open source, you can always download and compile it, if you are not a programmer you can download images of dockers that you can run, by hand or with jenkins or other tools 
<br>
As I have already mentioned before, we do not give magic solutions, we show an overview, a starting point for further investigation . 
<br>
It is important to know who participates in the development of a project, what functions and roles there are, what to do and what not to do.
<br> 
We will show all the steps performed, which people are involved in each step, decisions and how they pass the brown to the following. Show the different programming environments, all automatic, registered and independent of the people who perform it, no secrests no strangers things, trace of what has been done, know where we are and we are going.
